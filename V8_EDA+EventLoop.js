                            we will go through the following points :
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1- welcome to architecture      
| 2- single-threaded vs multi-threaded ?
| 3- Blocking Vs Non-Blocking
| 4- what is Event-driven architecture ( EDA ) , it's components and how it works ?
| 5- what is Event Loop , it's components and how it works ?
| 6- microtask Vs macrotask

** welcome to architecture !! 

- i would like to start with a very deap question : what is software architecture ?
=> software architecture is the fundamental organization of a software system, embodied in its components and their relationships to each other. 
=> It is the backbone that holds together the various components of a software system, ensuring they work together cohesively to fulfill the system's intended purpose.
=> it providing a clear understanding of how the system's components interact, communicate, and collaborate. It defines the overall structure, and relationships between the various components of the software system
=> we can say that the software architecture serves as a blueprint for the software's design ( software architecture is low-level design )
=> we have many types of software architecture like ( layered architecture , event-driven architecture , microservices architecture , etc ... )

- BUT why are we talking about software architecture ? ummmmmmm let's see
- the last articles we talked about main components of V8 engine right ?
- and as we all know that V8 is a normal software system so it has an architecture right ?

- but what is the architecture of V8 engine ?
=> V8 engine is a single-threaded application that uses an event-driven architecture and we will dicuss this in this article

** single-threaded vs multi-threaded ?


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Third Part : 

** what is Event-driven architecture ( EDA ) ?
=> Event-driven architecture is a software architecture pattern where the system responds to significant changes in state called "events."
=> these events represent significant occurrences or changes in the state of the system and trigger actions by other components. 
=> in simple words : EDA is a software architecture pattern that depends on events and these events are responsible for triggering actions by other components
=> ( if component A does something, then component B will do something else ) that's the main idea of EDA
